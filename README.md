##Overview

Conventional approaches to atlasing white matter structures follow a *tract-based* ontology: they assign locations in stereotaxic space to a relatively small number of gross white matter tracts from the classical neuroanatomy literature.

Problem is, they aren't particularly well-suited to network-based descriptions of brain organization.

Connectome-based white matter atlases take a different approach: they follow a *connectivity-based* ontology. The idea here is rather than following the classical anatomical tract nomenclature, to label white matter voxels according to the grey matter regions that their constituent fibers interconnect.

The benefit of this approach is that a scientist/clinician/citizen can take a set of (standard space) coordinates, or a nifti-format ROI mask such as a binary lesion map, and straightforwardly query which grey matter region pairs (i.e. connectome-edges) have fibers passing through those locations.

That information can then be used together with the used parcellation's *canonical connectome* (normative group-averaged connectivity matrix), to obtain a lesion-modified structural (macro) connectome. This can be done very quickly with zero tractography data or analysis required, and as little as a list of numbers (voxel coordinates) as input.

###Two dimensions: Ontology and Representation

The overview above described two kinds of white matter structure *ontology*: *tract-based* and *connectivity-based*. Whilst ConWhAt is mainly focused on the latter, it also completely supports tract-based analyses as well.

A second important distinction in diffusion MRI is between is the *representation* of anatomical data; the two main forms being *volumetric* and *streamlinetric* (tractography streamline-based).

Volumetric representations are simply standard 3D scalar nifti-type images. Streamlinetric representations are
vector-valued; basically they are lists of lists of coordinates. The distinction here is a little fuzzy, but it is significant does present significant differences in both analysis and intepretation at various points. Both volumetric and streamlinetric representations are supported in ConWhAt.



###Atlas Construction workflow

The connectivity-based atlases in ConWhAt are constructed based on [dipy](http://nipy.org/dipy/) determinstic whole-brain HARDI tractography reconstructions using HCP WU-Minn corpus. These streamlines are then segmented with region pairs using a broad set of brain parcellations, yielding anatomical connectivity matrices and connectome edge-labelled streamline sets. The streamlines are then entered into both volumetric and a streamlinetric atlas construction pipelines:

- Volumetric workfow: convert streamlines to track density images (visitation maps), spatially normalize, average  
- Streamlinetric workflow: spatially normalize streamlines, concatenate, cluster
